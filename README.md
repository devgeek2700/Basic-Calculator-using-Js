# Basic Calculator using Js

This basic calculator written in JavaScript. The calculator is built by adding event listeners to each button on the calculator. When a button is clicked, the function is called to determine what type of button was clicked and perform the appropriate action.

If a number button is clicked, the function adds the number to the display. If the decimal button is clicked, the function checks if there is already a decimal point in the display and adds one if there isn't. If an operator button is clicked, the function stores the first value, then store the operator and then the next value.

If the equals button is clicked, the function retrieves the first value, operator, and second value from the display element and passes them to the function to perform the appropriate calculation. The result is then returned and displayed on the calculator. If the clear button is clicked, the function resets the display and clears the data-first-value and data-operator attributes. If the backspace button is clicked, the function then remove the last element entered.

Overall, the code uses event listeners to create a functional calculator that can perform basic arithmetic calculations. It demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to create interactive user interfaces and perform calculations based on user input.
